## diaryman

Diary Manager for lazy software engineers who use vim.

`diaryman` automatically creates a file in specified diary directory if it doesn't exist: `$DIARY_DIR/$year/$month/$day.md` and opens it with `vim` in edit mode. If the file already exist, it will just open it, this allow multiple edits throughout the day.

This works great for personal diaries and also for work task organization.
